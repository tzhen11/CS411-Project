Proto 2 is here!!! --Yanru

Finished:
-- the construction of http://cs-people.bu.edu/yanruc/cs411/search_flights
   - 2 forms come with this website, but with only slight difference: the airport and flights
   - can search airports, hotels, restaurants by typing into the form
   - Yes, the third option is a joke
-- use hardcoded images on the index page rather than wasting API calls
-- added link to navigation bar and API used
-- redesign of navigation bar content

TODO:
--create a demo (probably video?) for using the website
--visa availability website construction
--about website construction ?? Or deletion
--figure out recommendation algorithm would be possible or not
